# Hypersubatomic VS Code Theme

The Syntax palette is inspired from a chromatic palette similar to Solarized, however, there are significant deviations. Hypersubatomic uses a more vibrant palette with higher saturation against a dark background to create a high contrast theme. Color luminosities have been carefully crafted by optical adjustment to create a balanced palette. The UI colorscheme is based on *Material Theme - Ocean High Contrast* with update Hypersubatomic palette.

Please file an issue if you find a bug or a PR for new language syntax features.
