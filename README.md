# Hypersubatomic VS Code Theme

The UI colorscheme is based on *Material Theme - Ocean High Contrast*. The Syntax palette is inspired from a chromatic palette similar to Solarized, however, there are significant deviations. Hypersubatomic uses a more vibrant palette with higher saturation against a dark background to create a high contrast theme. Color luminosities have been carefully crafted by optical adjustment to create a balanced palette.
